 <h3> Background Information </h3>
    
 <p2><center> Born June 4th, 1993. Newport WA </center></p2>
  
<h2> Personal Objectives</h2> 

  <p class="big">I am currently a student at Eastern Washington University and my passion is to be a professional designer for many companies. My end goal is to be designing for beer and wine companies, any snowboarding or skateboarding companies like Neff, Libtech, Enjoi or DC, or for a packaging company. One of the reasons why I decided to be a VCD major is because I love making and looking at designs/logos from other companies and after taking a couple classes here at Eastern, I knew that this is what I want to do with my life. Another reason why I want to further my education in VCD is because you can't have a succesful business without great logos and designs to help sell your product. </p>
